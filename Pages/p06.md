### üìå What is Correlation? 

**Correlation** measures the strength and direction of a linear relationship between two variables.

---

### üßÆ What is a Correlation Matrix?

A **correlation matrix** is a table showing correlation coefficients between many variables.

Example:

|       | A     | B     | C     |
| ----- | ----- | ----- | ----- |
| **A** | 1.00  | 0.85  | -0.30 |
| **B** | 0.85  | 1.00  | -0.60 |
| **C** | -0.30 | -0.60 | 1.00  |

Each cell shows the correlation between the variable in that row and the column.

### üìä What is a Correlation Matrix Plot?

A **correlation matrix plot** is a graphical representation of the **correlation coefficients** between multiple variables in a dataset. It helps visualize **how strongly variables are related to each other**, and in what direction (positive or negative). This is commonly used in **exploratory data analysis (EDA)** to identify patterns, relationships, and multicollinearity.

It‚Äôs a **visual heatmap** or **colored plot** of the correlation matrix where:

* **Colors or shades** represent the strength of the correlation.
* Optional: The values of the correlations are shown in the cells.
* Often, a **color bar** helps interpret the meaning of the color intensity.

### üîß Python Example using Seaborn

```python
import pandas as pd
import seaborn as sns
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

# Sample dataset
data = sns.load_dataset('iris')  # contains numeric features like sepal length, width, etc.

# Compute correlation matrix
corr_matrix = data.corr(numeric_only=True)

# Plot correlation matrix
plt.figure(figsize=(8, 6))
sns.heatmap(corr_matrix, annot=True, cmap='coolwarm', center=0)
plt.title("Correlation Matrix Plot")
plt.show()
```

---

### ‚úÖ How to Interpret

* üîµ **Strong Positive (close to +1)**: Bright red (or dark depending on color scale)
* ‚ö™ **No Correlation (\~0)**: Near white or neutral color
* üî¥ **Strong Negative (close to ‚Äì1)**: Dark blue (or intense cool color)

---

### üîç Use Cases

* Detect **multicollinearity** before regression
* Spot **redundant features**
* Discover **hidden patterns**
* Feature selection and dimensionality reduction

### üìä **Correlation Highlights**

#### 1. **Strong Relationships**

* `BMI` strongly correlated with `weight` (Pearson = **0.76**, Spearman = **0.85**)
* `ap_hi` (systolic) and `ap_lo` (diastolic) highly correlated (Spearman = **0.73**)

#### 2. **Risk Factors for Cardiovascular Disease**

* `age_years`, `ap_hi`, `BMI`, `cholesterol`, and `weight` show **positive correlations** with `cardio`
* **Spearman & Kendall** correlations with `cardio`:

  * `ap_hi`: \~**0.45**
  * `age_years`: \~**0.22**
  * `BMI`: \~**0.20**
  * `cholesterol`: \~**0.17**
  * `weight`: \~**0.18**

#### 3. **Lifestyle Indicators**

* `smoke`, `alco`, `active` show **low correlation** with `cardio`

### üß† Insights for Analysis

* ‚úÖ **Key predictors**: `age`, `ap_hi`, `BMI`, `cholesterol`, and `weight`
* üìâ **Low predictive value**: `smoke`, `alco`, and `gender` (though useful for subgroup analysis)
* üîÅ **Non-linear methods** (like Spearman, Kendall) better capture relationships than just Pearson

---

### Step - 1 : importing the dataset into a dataframe

```
import pandas as pd

# Load the dataset
file_path = 'cardio_train.csv'
df = pd.read_csv(file_path, sep=';')  # the delimiter is semicolon in this dataset

# Show the first few rows and column names
df.head(), df.columns.tolist()

```
The dataset has been successfully loaded. It includes the following features:

```
['id', 'age', 'gender', 'height', 'weight', 'ap_hi', 'ap_lo', 
 'cholesterol', 'gluc', 'smoke', 'alco', 'active', 'cardio']
```

Here's a brief explanation of the key variables useful for correlation analysis:

* **age** (in days ‚Äî can be converted to years)
* **height**, **weight** ‚Üí used to compute **BMI**
* **ap\_hi**, **ap\_lo** ‚Üí systolic and diastolic blood pressure
* **cholesterol**, **gluc** ‚Üí cholesterol and glucose levels (1=normal, 2=above normal, 3=well above normal)
* **smoke**, **alco**, **active** ‚Üí lifestyle indicators
* **cardio** ‚Üí target variable (1=presence of cardiovascular disease)

### Step 2 : Preparing the dataset

1. Convert `age` from days to years
2. Calculate **BMI**
3. Drop `id`
4. Generate the **correlation matrix** (Pearson, Spearman, Kendall)

Let‚Äôs proceed.

```
# Prepare the data
df['age_years'] = (df['age'] / 365).astype(int)
df['BMI'] = df['weight'] / ((df['height'] / 100) ** 2)

# Drop the 'id' and original 'age' columns to avoid confusion
df_clean = df.drop(columns=['id', 'age'])

```
## Step 3 : Generate three correlation matrices (Final step)

```
# Generate three correlation matrices
pearson_corr = df_clean.corr(method='pearson')
spearman_corr = df_clean.corr(method='spearman')
kendall_corr = df_clean.corr(method='kendall')

```

### Pearson_correlation Data

```
print ("pearson_correlation Data  :")
print (pearson_corr)

```

You are now viewing the **Pearson Correlation Matrix**, which measures **linear relationships** between variables.

### üîç Key Insights from Pearson Correlation:

* **BMI** has:

  * A **strong positive correlation with weight** (**0.76**)
  * A **moderate negative correlation with height** (**‚Äì0.29**)

* **Weight** is moderately correlated with:

  * **Cholesterol** (0.14)
  * **BMI** (0.76)
  * **Cardio disease** (0.18)

* **Age (in years)** has a **positive correlation with cardio** (0.18), suggesting older individuals are more likely to have cardiovascular disease.

* **Blood pressure (ap\_hi and ap\_lo)** shows low but positive correlation with **cardio**.

* **Gender and smoking** are positively correlated (0.34), possibly indicating more men smoke in this dataset.

### Spearman_correlation Data

```
print ("spearman_correlation Data  :")
print (spearman_corr)
```
You are now viewing the **Spearman Correlation Matrix**, which captures **monotonic (rank-based) relationships** ‚Äî helpful even when the relationship is **non-linear**.

### üîç Key Insights from Spearman Correlation:

* **BMI** remains **strongly correlated with weight** (0.85) and **moderately negatively correlated with height** (‚Äì0.18).
* **Blood Pressure:**

  * `ap_hi` (systolic) and `ap_lo` (diastolic) are **very strongly correlated** (**0.73**), as expected.
  * `ap_hi` has a **moderate positive correlation with cardio** (**0.45**) ‚Äì much higher than in the Pearson matrix.
* **Age (years)** and **cardio** correlation: **0.22**, slightly stronger than in Pearson, again indicating **cardiovascular risk increases with age**.
* `weight`, `cholesterol`, and `gluc` show slightly higher correlations with `cardio`, suggesting **lifestyle/metabolic health is a key factor**.

---

### Kendall_correlation Data

```
print ("kendall_correlation Data  :")
print (kendall_corr)

```

You are now viewing the **Kendall Correlation Matrix**, which measures **ordinal (rank-based) association** and is particularly robust to **non-linear relationships and outliers**.

### üîç Key Insights from Kendall Correlation:

* **BMI** and **weight** still show **strong correlation** (**0.67**), confirming consistent patterns across all methods.
* **Systolic and diastolic BP** (`ap_hi` and `ap_lo`) are **very strongly correlated** (**0.66**), indicating consistent co-movement.
* **ap\_hi** and `cardio`: **0.40**, still suggesting a **notable link between high systolic pressure and heart disease**.
* **age\_years** and `cardio`: **0.16**, shows again that aging increases heart risk.
* **Weight**, **cholesterol**, and **glucose** also have mild positive correlations with `cardio`.

## Summary of all the methods of generating correlations

### üìä **Pearson Correlation**

* Best for **linear relationships**
* Useful when variables are normally distributed

### üîÅ **Spearman Correlation**

* Captures **monotonic** relationships (even if non-linear)
* More robust to outliers and skewed distributions

### üß± **Kendall Correlation**

* Based on the **ranking of pairs**
* Even more robust for small datasets or many ties

---

### üîç Notable Patterns Across All Plots:

* **BMI ‚Üî Weight**: consistently strong positive correlation
* **Blood Pressure (ap\_hi, ap\_lo)**: strongly related
* **Cardio Disease Risk**: more associated with `ap_hi`, `age`, `weight`, `cholesterol`, `BMI`

Let me know if you'd like:

* A focus on visualizing **cardio vs risk factors**
* Feature selection using correlation threshold
* Or prediction modeling (e.g., logistic regression or decision tree)
