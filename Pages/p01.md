## Line Charts and Their Applications

#### ✅ **What is a Line Chart?**

A **line chart** (or line graph) is a type of graph used to **visualize data points in a time series or sequential order**. It uses straight lines to connect **data points** plotted on a 2D graph — **X-axis** usually shows **time**, and **Y-axis** shows the **value** of the variable.

---

#### 🧠 **Purpose of Line Charts**

* To **track changes over time** (daily, monthly, yearly).
* To **compare trends** between multiple variables.
* To **spot patterns**, such as rising, falling, or cyclical trends.

---

#### 🔍 **When to Use Line Charts**

* Data is **continuous** (e.g., temperature, sales, stock prices).
* You want to **observe trends** over a period.
* You need to **compare multiple datasets** on the same chart.

#### 📊 **Parts of a Line Chart**

| Component     | Description                             |
| ------------- | --------------------------------------- |
| X-axis        | Typically shows time or categories      |
| Y-axis        | Represents the variable being measured  |
| Data points   | Individual values plotted as dots       |
| Line segments | Connect dots to show the trend or flow  |
| Legend        | (Optional) Identifies multiple datasets |
| Title         | Describes what the chart is about       |

---

#### 📌 **Example**

**Data**: Monthly average temperature (°C) in a city.

| Month | Temperature |
| ----- | ----------- |
| Jan   | 15          |
| Feb   | 17          |
| Mar   | 22          |
| Apr   | 28          |
| May   | 34          |

**Line Chart**:

* X-axis = Months
* Y-axis = Temperature
* Each point is plotted and connected with a line to show temperature changes month by month.

---

#### 🧮 **Python Example with Matplotlib**

```python
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

# Data
months = ['Jan', 'Feb', 'Mar', 'Apr', 'May']
temperature = [15, 17, 22, 28, 34]

# Create line chart
plt.plot(months, temperature, marker='o', linestyle='-', color='blue')
plt.title('Average Monthly Temperature')
plt.xlabel('Month')
plt.ylabel('Temperature (°C)')
plt.grid(True)
plt.show()
```

---

#### 📈 **Types of Line Charts**

1. **Single Line Chart**

   * Shows one variable over time.

2. **Multi-Line Chart**

   * Compares multiple variables (e.g., temperature in two cities).

3. **Smooth Line Chart (Spline)**

   * Uses curves for smoother visual transition.

---

#### ✅ **Advantages**

* Simple to read and interpret.
* Great for tracking **trends** and **patterns**.
* Effective for **forecasting** when trends are consistent.

---

#### ⚠️ **Limitations**

* Not ideal for categorical data.
* Can become cluttered with too many lines.
* Not useful when data is scattered or non-continuous.

## 📊 Types of Line Charts with Examples and Applications

---

### **1. Simple Line Chart**

**📌 Description:**
Plots a single line to show how one variable changes over time or sequence.

**🔍 Example:**
Plotting monthly sales for one product.

```python
months = ['Jan', 'Feb', 'Mar', 'Apr', 'May']
sales = [100, 120, 150, 130, 160]
plt.plot(months, sales)
```

**✅ Application:**

* Showing temperature over a year
* Monitoring profit trend of a single store
* Stock price movement of one company

---

### **2. Multiple Line Chart**

**📌 Description:**
Plots more than one line on the same chart to compare multiple variables.

**🔍 Example:**
Comparing sales of two products over 5 months.

```python
product_a = [100, 120, 150, 130, 160]
product_b = [90, 110, 140, 120, 150]
plt.plot(months, product_a, label='Product A')
plt.plot(months, product_b, label='Product B')
plt.legend()
```

**✅ Application:**

* Comparing performance of multiple students over time
* Multi-city temperature comparisons
* Product vs product growth analysis

---

### **3. Stacked Line Chart (Cumulative Line Chart)**

**📌 Description:**
Lines are stacked on top of each other to show cumulative totals.

**🔍 Example:**
Cumulative website visits from different sources.

```python
organic = [100, 150, 200, 250, 300]
referral = [50, 70, 100, 120, 140]
direct = [30, 50, 80, 90, 100]

# Cumulative
referral_cum = [o+r for o, r in zip(organic, referral)]
direct_cum = [o+r+d for o, r, d in zip(organic, referral, direct)]

plt.plot(months, organic, label='Organic')
plt.plot(months, referral_cum, label='Referral')
plt.plot(months, direct_cum, label='Direct')
plt.legend()
```

**✅ Application:**

* Tracking total sales across multiple categories
* Website traffic composition over time
* Layered population growth

---

### **4. 100% Stacked Line Chart**

**📌 Description:**
Displays percentage contribution of each component at every time point.

**🔍 Example:**
% contribution of each department to total expenses.

**✅ Application:**

* Budget allocation trends
* Market share evolution
* Resource utilization tracking

---

### **5. Smooth Line Chart (Spline Chart)**

**📌 Description:**
Uses curves instead of straight lines to show smoother transitions.

**🔍 Example:**
Showing atmospheric pressure over time with minor fluctuations.

**✅ Application:**

* Weather trend representation
* Heart rate tracking in health apps
* Any data where sudden jumps don’t look natural

---

### **6. Step Line Chart**

**📌 Description:**
Lines move in horizontal and vertical steps to indicate discrete changes.

**🔍 Example:**
Electricity rate slabs based on usage units.

```python
plt.step(months, sales, where='mid')
```

**✅ Application:**

* Pricing tier changes
* Inventory level updates
* Network packet transmission

---

### **7. Area Line Chart**

**📌 Description:**
A line chart where the area below the line is filled with color.

**🔍 Example:**
Total revenue earned each month.

```python
plt.fill_between(months, sales, color='skyblue', alpha=0.4)
plt.plot(months, sales)
```

**✅ Application:**

* Visualizing total resource consumption
* Energy usage over time
* Rainfall accumulation

---

### **8. Dashed or Custom Styled Line Chart**

**📌 Description:**
Uses custom line styles (dashed, dotted, colored) for better visual separation.

**🔍 Example:**
Different product lines shown with unique styles.

```python
plt.plot(months, product_a, linestyle='--', color='blue')
plt.plot(months, product_b, linestyle=':', color='green')
```

**✅ Application:**

* Report visuals
* Presentation-ready charts
* Differentiating multiple categories clearly
