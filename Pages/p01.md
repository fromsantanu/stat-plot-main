## Line Charts and Their Applications

#### ✅ **What is a Line Chart?**

A **line chart** (or line graph) is a type of graph used to **visualize data points in a time series or sequential order**. It uses straight lines to connect **data points** plotted on a 2D graph — **X-axis** usually shows **time**, and **Y-axis** shows the **value** of the variable.

---

#### 🧠 **Purpose of Line Charts**

* To **track changes over time** (daily, monthly, yearly).
* To **compare trends** between multiple variables.
* To **spot patterns**, such as rising, falling, or cyclical trends.

---

#### 🔍 **When to Use Line Charts**

* Data is **continuous** (e.g., temperature, sales, stock prices).
* You want to **observe trends** over a period.
* You need to **compare multiple datasets** on the same chart.

#### 📊 **Parts of a Line Chart**

| Component     | Description                             |
| ------------- | --------------------------------------- |
| X-axis        | Typically shows time or categories      |
| Y-axis        | Represents the variable being measured  |
| Data points   | Individual values plotted as dots       |
| Line segments | Connect dots to show the trend or flow  |
| Legend        | (Optional) Identifies multiple datasets |
| Title         | Describes what the chart is about       |

#### 📌 **Example**

**Data**: Monthly average temperature (°C) in a city.

| Month | Temperature |
| ----- | ----------- |
| Jan   | 15          |
| Feb   | 17          |
| Mar   | 22          |
| Apr   | 28          |
| May   | 34          |

**Line Chart**:

* X-axis = Months
* Y-axis = Temperature
* Each point is plotted and connected with a line to show temperature changes month by month.

#### 🧮 **Python Example with Matplotlib**

```python
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

# Data
months = ['Jan', 'Feb', 'Mar', 'Apr', 'May']
temperature = [15, 17, 22, 28, 34]

# Create line chart
plt.plot(months, temperature, marker='o', linestyle='-', color='blue')
plt.title('Average Monthly Temperature')
plt.xlabel('Month')
plt.ylabel('Temperature (°C)')
plt.grid(True)
plt.show()
```

#### 📈 **Types of Line Charts**

1. **Single Line Chart**

   * Shows one variable over time.

2. **Multi-Line Chart**

   * Compares multiple variables (e.g., temperature in two cities).

3. **Smooth Line Chart (Spline)**

   * Uses curves for smoother visual transition.

---

#### ✅ **Advantages**

* Simple to read and interpret.
* Great for tracking **trends** and **patterns**.
* Effective for **forecasting** when trends are consistent.

---

#### ⚠️ **Limitations**

* Not ideal for categorical data.
* Can become cluttered with too many lines.
* Not useful when data is scattered or non-continuous.
