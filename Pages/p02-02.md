# Notes on Standard Error and its Plotting

### Formula for Standard Error (SE)

If you have:

* Sample size = **n**
* Sample mean = **xÃÑ** (you don‚Äôt need mean to calculate SE)
* Sample standard deviation = **s**

The **standard error of the mean (SE)** is calculated as:

$$
SE = \frac{s}{\sqrt{n}}
$$

---

### Example

Suppose:

* Sample size (n) = 25
* Sample mean (xÃÑ) = 50 (not needed here)
* Sample standard deviation (s) = 10

Then:

$$
SE = \frac{10}{\sqrt{25}} = \frac{10}{5} = 2
$$

So, **SE = 2**.

---

### What does SE mean?

* SE tells you how much the sample mean would vary if you took many samples.
* Smaller SE means your sample mean is more precise.

---

üëâ **Summary:**

If you have sample standard deviation and sample size, divide standard deviation by square root of sample size ‚Äî that‚Äôs your Standard Error.

---

### 1Ô∏è‚É£ You have samples like:

| Sample | n (sample size) | Mean | SD (standard deviation) |
| ------ | --------------- | ---- | ----------------------- |
| A      | 20              | 50   | 10                      |
| B      | 30              | 55   | 12                      |
| C      | 25              | 60   | 9                       |
| D      | 15              | 53   | 11                      |

---

### 2Ô∏è‚É£ You calculate Standard Error for each sample:

$$
SE = \frac{SD}{\sqrt{n}}
$$

For Sample A:

$$
SE_A = \frac{10}{\sqrt{20}} = \frac{10}{4.472} \approx 2.236
$$

Similarly calculate SE for B, C, D.

---

### 3Ô∏è‚É£ You can now draw plots:

* **Bar Plot**

  * X-axis: Samples (A, B, C, D)
  * Y-axis: Means
  * Error bars: SE for each sample.

* **Line Plot (if your samples are ordered in time or category)**

  * X-axis: Samples (A, B, C, D)
  * Y-axis: Means
  * Error bars: SE for each point.

---

### 4Ô∏è‚É£ What do these error bars show?

* They visually show the uncertainty or variability in your mean estimate.
* Smaller SE ‚Üí shorter error bars ‚Üí more confidence in mean.

---

üëâ **Summary:**
Yes! Once you have size, mean and SD ‚Äî you can calculate SE and easily build line plots or bar plots with error bars.

### üêç Complete Python Code for Line Plot

```python
import pandas as pd
import numpy as np
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

# Create data
data = pd.DataFrame({
    'Sample': ['A', 'B', 'C', 'D'],
    'n': [20, 30, 25, 15],
    'Mean': [50, 55, 60, 53],
    'SD': [10, 12, 9, 11]
})

# Calculate Standard Error
data['SE'] = data['SD'] / np.sqrt(data['n'])

# For line plot we need numeric x-axis
data['Sample_order'] = np.arange(len(data))

# Plotting Line Plot with Error Bars
plt.figure(figsize=(8,6))

plt.errorbar(
    data['Sample_order'],       # numeric x-axis
    data['Mean'],               # y-axis (mean)
    yerr=data['SE'],            # error bars
    fmt='o-',                   # circle markers with line
    capsize=5,                  # caps on error bars
    color='blue', 
    ecolor='red',               # color of error bars
    elinewidth=2
)

# Replace numeric x-axis with actual labels
plt.xticks(data['Sample_order'], data['Sample'])

plt.title('Line Plot with Standard Error Bars')
plt.xlabel('Sample')
plt.ylabel('Mean Value')
plt.grid(True)
plt.show()
```

---

### üîé Explanation of New Parts:

* `plt.errorbar()` is the main function for line plots with error bars.
* `fmt='o-'` means: draw circles (`o`) and lines (`-`) connecting them.
* `capsize=5` makes small horizontal caps at the end of error bars.
* `plt.xticks()` replaces numeric x-axis with actual sample labels.

---

‚úÖ **Now you have:**

* A clear **Line Plot** with error bars (SE)
* Same data, just a different way to visualize.
