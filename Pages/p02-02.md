# Notes on Standard Error and its Plotting

### Formula for Standard Error (SE)

If you have:

* Sample size = **n**
* Sample mean = **xÃÑ** (you don‚Äôt need mean to calculate SE)
* Sample standard deviation = **s**

The **standard error of the mean (SE)** is calculated as:

$$
SE = \frac{s}{\sqrt{n}}
$$

---

### Example

Suppose:

* Sample size (n) = 25
* Sample mean (xÃÑ) = 50 (not needed here)
* Sample standard deviation (s) = 10

Then:

$$
SE = \frac{10}{\sqrt{25}} = \frac{10}{5} = 2
$$

So, **SE = 2**.

### What does SE mean?

* SE tells you how much the sample mean would vary if you took many samples.
* Smaller SE means your sample mean is more precise.

---

üëâ **Summary:**

If you have sample standard deviation and sample size, divide standard deviation by square root of sample size ‚Äî that‚Äôs your Standard Error.

### 1Ô∏è‚É£ You have samples like:

| Sample | n (sample size) | Mean | SD (standard deviation) |
| ------ | --------------- | ---- | ----------------------- |
| A      | 20              | 50   | 10                      |
| B      | 30              | 55   | 12                      |
| C      | 25              | 60   | 9                       |
| D      | 15              | 53   | 11                      |

---

### 2Ô∏è‚É£ You calculate Standard Error for each sample:

$$
SE = \frac{SD}{\sqrt{n}}
$$

For Sample A:

$$
SE_A = \frac{10}{\sqrt{20}} = \frac{10}{4.472} \approx 2.236
$$

Similarly calculate SE for B, C, D.

### 3Ô∏è‚É£ You can now draw plots:

* **Bar Plot**

  * X-axis: Samples (A, B, C, D)
  * Y-axis: Means
  * Error bars: SE for each sample.

* **Line Plot (if your samples are ordered in time or category)**

  * X-axis: Samples (A, B, C, D)
  * Y-axis: Means
  * Error bars: SE for each point.

---

### 4Ô∏è‚É£ What do these error bars show?

* They visually show the uncertainty or variability in your mean estimate.
* Smaller SE ‚Üí shorter error bars ‚Üí more confidence in mean.

---

üëâ **Summary:**
Yes! Once you have size, mean and SD ‚Äî you can calculate SE and easily build line plots or bar plots with error bars.
