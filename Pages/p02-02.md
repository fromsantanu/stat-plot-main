# Notes on Standard Error and its Plotting

### Formula for Standard Error (SE)

If you have:

* Sample size = **n**
* Sample mean = **xÌ„** (you donâ€™t need mean to calculate SE)
* Sample standard deviation = **s**

The **standard error of the mean (SE)** is calculated as:

$$
SE = \frac{s}{\sqrt{n}}
$$

---

### Example

Suppose:

* Sample size (n) = 25
* Sample mean (xÌ„) = 50 (not needed here)
* Sample standard deviation (s) = 10

Then:

$$
SE = \frac{10}{\sqrt{25}} = \frac{10}{5} = 2
$$

So, **SE = 2**.

### What does SE mean?

* SE tells you how much the sample mean would vary if you took many samples.
* Smaller SE means your sample mean is more precise.

---

ðŸ‘‰ **Summary:**

If you have sample standard deviation and sample size, divide standard deviation by square root of sample size â€” thatâ€™s your Standard Error.

If you want, I can also show you:

* formula for **standard error of proportion**
* formula for **standard error of difference of means**
