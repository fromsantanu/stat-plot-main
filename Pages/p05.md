## üì¶ What is a Box Plot?

A **box plot** (also called a **box-and-whisker plot**) is a **graphical summary of a dataset** that shows:

* The **distribution**
* **Central tendency**
* **Spread**
* **Presence of outliers**

It is particularly useful in **descriptive statistics** for comparing distributions across groups.

---

## üìå Core Components of a Box Plot

A typical box plot consists of:

```
Minimum ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îê
            ‚ñº
           [‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî|‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî|‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî]
            ‚ñ≤   ‚ñ≤   ‚ñ≤
        Q1 (LQ)  | Q3 (UQ)
                 ‚ñº
               Median (Q2)

Whiskers extend to:
  - Smallest non-outlier (lower fence)
  - Largest non-outlier (upper fence)

Points beyond whiskers = outliers
```

### üîπ Key Terms:

| Term                          | Meaning                                    |
| ----------------------------- | ------------------------------------------ |
| **Min**                       | Lowest non-outlier value                   |
| **Q1 (1st Quartile)**         | 25% of data below this value               |
| **Median (Q2)**               | Middle value (50th percentile)             |
| **Q3 (3rd Quartile)**         | 75% of data below this value               |
| **Max**                       | Highest non-outlier value                  |
| **IQR (Interquartile Range)** | Q3 - Q1                                    |
| **Whiskers**                  | Typically extend to 1.5√óIQR from Q1 and Q3 |
| **Outliers**                  | Data points outside the whiskers           |

---

## üìä Types of Box Plots

### 1. **Standard Box Plot**

* Displays Q1, median, Q3, and whiskers (extending to non-outlier limits).
* Outliers are shown as individual points.

**Use Case:** Understand distribution and detect outliers.

---

### 2. **Notched Box Plot**

* Shows a **notch** around the median.
* If notches **don‚Äôt overlap** between two groups, their medians differ significantly (approximation).

**Use Case:** Compare medians visually.

---

### 3. **Grouped Box Plot (or Side-by-Side Box Plot)**

* Compares distributions across multiple categories (e.g., box plot for each city, gender, etc.)

**Use Case:** Compare groups easily (e.g., income by gender).

---

### 4. **Violin Plot (Enhanced Box Plot)**

* Combines a box plot with a **kernel density plot** to show the distribution's shape.

**Use Case:** Shows both summary and distribution shape.

---

### 5. **Horizontal Box Plot**

* Same as standard box plot but oriented horizontally.

**Use Case:** Better for long variable names or when space is constrained vertically.

---

## ‚úÖ Example in Python (Matplotlib/Seaborn)

```python
import seaborn as sns
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

# Sample dataset
tips = sns.load_dataset('tips')

# Standard box plot
sns.boxplot(x='day', y='total_bill', data=tips)
plt.title('Box Plot of Total Bill by Day')
plt.show()
```

---

## üìå Summary of Use

| Purpose                  | Box Plot Feature        |
| ------------------------ | ----------------------- |
| Show spread and outliers | Box, whiskers, and dots |
| Compare groups           | Grouped box plots       |
| Show median differences  | Notched box plots       |
| Show distribution shape  | Violin plots            |

---
---

## ‚úÖ 1. Standard Box Plot

### üîπ What It Shows:

A **standard box plot** summarizes a numerical dataset using:

* **Minimum** (excluding outliers)
* **First quartile (Q1)**
* **Median (Q2)**
* **Third quartile (Q3)**
* **Maximum** (excluding outliers)
* **Outliers** (shown as dots beyond 1.5√óIQR from Q1 or Q3)

### üîπ Use Case:

It helps us visualize:

* Central value (median)
* Spread (IQR)
* Skewness
* Outliers

---

## üìä Python Example ‚Äì Standard Box Plot

We'll use the **`tips`** dataset from Seaborn, which includes restaurant bills.

```python
import seaborn as sns
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

# Load example dataset
tips = sns.load_dataset('tips')

# Create a standard box plot
plt.figure(figsize=(8, 5))
sns.boxplot(x='day', y='total_bill', data=tips)

# Add titles and labels
plt.title('Standard Box Plot of Total Bill by Day')
plt.xlabel('Day of the Week')
plt.ylabel('Total Bill Amount ($)')
plt.show()
```

---

### üìå Interpretation:

* **Each box** shows the distribution of `total_bill` for each `day` (`Thur`, `Fri`, `Sat`, `Sun`)
* **Middle line** = median
* **Box** = interquartile range (IQR: Q1 to Q3)
* **Whiskers** = non-outlier range (typically Q1‚àí1.5√óIQR to Q3+1.5√óIQR)
* **Dots** = outliers beyond whiskers

---
```
import seaborn as sns
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

# Load example dataset
tips = sns.load_dataset('tips')

# Create a standard box plot
plt.figure(figsize=(8, 5))
sns.boxplot(x='day', y='total_bill', data=tips)

# Add titles and labels
plt.title('Standard Box Plot of Total Bill by Day')
plt.xlabel('Day of the Week')
plt.ylabel('Total Bill Amount ($)')
plt.show()

```
---

## ‚úÖ 2. Notched Box Plot

### üîπ What Is It?

A **notched box plot** is a variation of the standard box plot that includes a **notch around the median**.

### üîπ Purpose of the Notch:

The **notch** represents a **confidence interval** around the median.
It helps you **visually compare medians** between groups:

* **If notches **do not overlap**, it's strong evidence the medians are significantly different**.
* **If notches overlap**, the medians might not be significantly different.

---

## üìä Python Example ‚Äì Notched Box Plot

Seaborn doesn't support notches directly, but we can use **Matplotlib** with **Pandas** or **raw matplotlib**.

Here‚Äôs an example using `matplotlib.pyplot.boxplot()` with `notch=True`.

```python
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
import seaborn as sns

# Load sample dataset
tips = sns.load_dataset("tips")

# Split data by gender
male_bills = tips[tips['sex'] == 'Male']['total_bill']
female_bills = tips[tips['sex'] == 'Female']['total_bill']

# Plot notched box plot
plt.figure(figsize=(7, 5))
plt.boxplot([male_bills, female_bills], notch=True, labels=['Male', 'Female'])

# Add title and axis labels
plt.title('Notched Box Plot of Total Bill by Gender')
plt.ylabel('Total Bill Amount ($)')
plt.xlabel('Gender')
plt.grid(True)
plt.show()
```

---

### üìå Interpretation

* Each box shows the distribution of `total_bill` by gender.
* The **notch** represents the **95% confidence interval of the median**.
* **If the notches of Male and Female do not overlap**, their medians are likely significantly different.

---

## ‚úÖ Summary

| Feature             | Purpose                                    |
| ------------------- | ------------------------------------------ |
| Notch               | Shows CI around median                     |
| No Overlap in Notch | Suggests significant median difference     |
| Visual Tool         | Great for comparing medians between groups |

---

```
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
import seaborn as sns

# Load sample dataset
tips = sns.load_dataset("tips")

# Split data by gender
male_bills = tips[tips['sex'] == 'Male']['total_bill']
female_bills = tips[tips['sex'] == 'Female']['total_bill']

# Plot notched box plot
plt.figure(figsize=(7, 5))
plt.boxplot([male_bills, female_bills], notch=True, tick_labels=['Male', 'Female'])


# Add title and axis labels
plt.title('Notched Box Plot of Total Bill by Gender')
plt.ylabel('Total Bill Amount ($)')
plt.xlabel('Gender')
plt.grid(True)
plt.show()

```

## ‚úÖ 3. Grouped Box Plot (or Side-by-Side Box Plot)

### üîπ What Is It?

A **grouped box plot** shows **multiple box plots** side by side, grouped by a **categorical variable**.
This is useful for **comparing distributions** across different **categories**.

---

### üéØ Use Case:

* Compare salaries across departments.
* Compare total bills across days of the week.
* Compare test scores across different schools.

---

## üìä Python Example ‚Äî Grouped Box Plot using `Seaborn`

Let‚Äôs use the `tips` dataset from Seaborn to compare **`total_bill`** grouped by **`day`** and further grouped by **`sex`** (i.e., nested grouping).

```python
import seaborn as sns
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

# Load the sample dataset
tips = sns.load_dataset("tips")

# Create grouped (side-by-side) box plot
plt.figure(figsize=(8, 5))
sns.boxplot(x="day", y="total_bill", hue="sex", data=tips)

# Add title and axis labels
plt.title("Grouped Box Plot of Total Bill by Day and Gender")
plt.xlabel("Day of the Week")
plt.ylabel("Total Bill Amount ($)")
plt.legend(title="Gender")
plt.show()
```

---

### üìå Interpretation:

* Each **day** has two box plots: one for **Male** and one for **Female**.
* You can compare:

  * Median spending per gender.
  * Variability and outliers.
  * Differences across both day and gender.

---

### ‚úÖ Summary

| Feature         | Description                                     |
| --------------- | ----------------------------------------------- |
| Multiple Groups | Box plots are grouped by one or more categories |
| Comparison      | Helps compare distributions across sub-groups   |
| hue= parameter  | Enables colored subgrouping in Seaborn          |

---

```
import seaborn as sns
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

# Load the sample dataset
tips = sns.load_dataset("tips")

# Create grouped (side-by-side) box plot
plt.figure(figsize=(8, 5))
sns.boxplot(x="day", y="total_bill", hue="sex", data=tips)

# Add title and axis labels
plt.title("Grouped Box Plot of Total Bill by Day and Gender")
plt.xlabel("Day of the Week")
plt.ylabel("Total Bill Amount ($)")
plt.legend(title="Gender")
plt.show()

```

---

## ‚úÖ 4. Violin Plot (Enhanced Box Plot)

### üîπ What Is a Violin Plot?

A **violin plot** is a combination of a **box plot** and a **kernel density plot**. It provides:

* Summary statistics (like a box plot): **median, quartiles, range**
* A **density curve** to show the **distribution shape** of the data

This allows you to **see both spread and shape** of the distribution in one plot.

---

### üéØ Use Case:

* When you want to see **how the data is distributed** beyond just quartiles.
* Helps detect **skewness**, **multi-modal patterns**, and **peaks** in the data.

---

## üìä Python Example ‚Äî Violin Plot using Seaborn

```python
import seaborn as sns
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

# Load the sample dataset
tips = sns.load_dataset("tips")

# Create a violin plot
plt.figure(figsize=(8, 5))
sns.violinplot(x="day", y="total_bill", data=tips)

# Add title and labels
plt.title("Violin Plot of Total Bill by Day")
plt.xlabel("Day of the Week")
plt.ylabel("Total Bill Amount ($)")
plt.show()
```

---

### üìå Interpretation:

* Each **violin** shape shows the **distribution** of `total_bill` for a given `day`.
* **Thicker regions** = more data points there (high density).
* **Thin tails** = fewer data points (low density).
* The **white dot** inside = **median**.
* The **thick bar** in the center = **interquartile range (Q1 to Q3)**.

---

### üß† Optional: Add `hue` for Grouping

To compare **male vs female**:

```python
sns.violinplot(x="day", y="total_bill", hue="sex", data=tips, split=True)
```

* `split=True` places both groups in the same violin for each day.

---

## ‚úÖ Summary

| Feature        | Description                                               |
| -------------- | --------------------------------------------------------- |
| Shape          | Shows distribution shape (density plot)                   |
| Central Values | Median and IQR visible (like box plot)                    |
| Useful For     | Understanding distribution shape and comparing categories |
